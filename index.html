  <h1 class="center">About Me</h1>
  
  <p id="para1">My name is Brandon Courtney. At the time of writing this, I am an 18-year-old student at Florida Gulf Coast University. I have a part-time job at a Dairy Queen in Cape Coral, Florida. At Florida Gulf Coast University, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. After graduating from FGCU in the spring of 2022, I plan on obtaining a job at a video game company as a programmer or as a software engineer.</p>
  
  <p>If I could choose two words to describe myself, they would have to be determined and kind. From a young age, I was given a great work ethic by my family. This work ethic gave me determination to achieve anything that I wanted to achieve. Also, from a young age, I learned that being kind is a great way to ensure that you are treated kindly. If everyone would treat each other with kindness, alot of the cruelty that plagues our world would fade away and the world would be a better place.</p>
